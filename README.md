# Trey Kockelman Team Profile Generator

  
  ## Description
  The purpose of this webpage was to prompt the user for their team information and give them a nice HTML page displaying all the information. There were many challenges that came with this project. One was the new syntax with back end development. Another difficulty was awaiting the information during the inputs from the user and getting the cards after that info was given. The last challenge was writing the tests as this was my first time using TTD.
